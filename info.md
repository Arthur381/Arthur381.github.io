## 注意事项
Jekyll can make HTML File automatically, but there are some mistakes about draw the table.
(I find it can beautify the Page by set CSS)
If I want to create a simple link I just need to link the folder's name. When I click the link, it will look for the index.html file priorly. If failed, then try to open README.md. 
**Note**: README.md often fails to render a formual.:|
If your page contains no formual, remember to use README.md as link engine. They are very easier to change.   :sleeping:
If you still seek for normative and beautiful personal web, learn to use more powerful tool and  css settings.:smile:
